A high-magnitude earthquake event causes great damage to the San Francisco Bay area and brings disorder to the city. In the chaos that ensues following the earthquake, many different scenarios arise that must be resolved by different local, state, and national actors. 
The objective of this simulation is to resolve different scenarios that occur in the aftermath of the earthquake as an assigned role. Participants will work through the events of the simulation either alone or with other actors depending on what each scenario calls for. The learning objectives for this simulation is for participants to be able to understand how large scale natural disasters (earthquakes) can trigger cascading  events across multiple sectors. Our simulation will aim to encourage participants to use strategic thinking, problem solving and critical thinking to solve different threats.
