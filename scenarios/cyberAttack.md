# Cyber Attack hits San Francisco

Due to the tech company declaring Bankruptcy, there is no one to handle various tech duties that the city needs. This has caused attackers from a different country to attack the city of San Francisco. This cyber attack is so bad that it has hit the hospitals. Hospitals and Doctors are not able to see patient records so they cannot perform the tasks they need on the patients from the earthquakes.
