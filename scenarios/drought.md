# Drought

Due to the drought, Residents are limited to minimal water use but many are not following these rules causing for an even greater water scarce. Low-income communities struggle the most, often lacking access to clean bottled water and facing higher utility costs. Businesses like restaurants and laundromats are suffering, while nearby farmland lies fallow which has caused the price of food to go up and many crops being damaged. The drought has also increased wildfire risk and public frustration, leading to protests and demands for better water management.
